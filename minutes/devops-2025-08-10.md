**ðŸ‘¤ Participants:**
1. Siddharath
2. Adithya Nandakumar

We came up with a file structure for the PHP code, and also a formal definition of what each page is supposed to do. This will help us set a clearer direction for developing this project.

We also decided on the Database schema.

Please view the [`devops/ERP Documentation.md`](https://github.com/vennby/microsoft-minutes/blob/main/devops/ERP%20Documentation.md) file, it has the following info in it:
- Some important Terminology
- Database Schema (Tables)
- Pages and File Structure
