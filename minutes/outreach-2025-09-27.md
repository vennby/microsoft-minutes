 - Next 2 blog posts- Prasannah and Diya Freddy
 - Newsletter- Saanvi, Venn and Prasannah to complete by 28 Sep
 - Monthly survey- rather than doing a lengthy survey, we can try making a reel? So final idea- September- Google form survey
October- reel survey
Nov onwards- depending on which worked better
 - SmartLife volunteering needs to be streamlined- can text club members every week to remind. Can start taking non members too.

     - The plan is to get sponsors for other mini events in October and collect cash to use in November.
    - Burger Society- 600 AED for 6 and 7 October (Excel Championship), plus 800 AED for Ready Player One
    - Dunkin' Donuts- 20% of stall revenue for 3 days in October- 14, 15, 16 (Biotech CTF)
    - Try getting WeDesi, Royal Hyderabad etc. For Ready Player One.
    - Other food stall options.
    - Chaos Karts will confirm regarding 10K.
    - Almarai will give beverages and snacks.
    - Can use these stalls to pre-market Ready Player One. 
    - Get details from Dunkin and Burger Society to draw up contracts- wattage, dates, what do they expect from us in terms of live marketing? Any live events at the stall?
