Siddharath suggested using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) for frontend dev.

Today's progress:
1. Set up an [InfinityFree](https://dash.infinityfree.com/login) profile and created an account for the ERP website
2. Configured Cloudflare to point the [erp.mtcbpdc.org](https://erp.mtcbpdc.org) domain to our new website
3. Created an empty database
4. Installed WordPress 6.8.1 into the website, and performed very basic configuration on the Admin account
5. Created a boilerplate code for our own WordPress Theme

View the "Micromanager ERP" document for some important theory on how all of this works, and what all of these words mean.
